              Lincoln's Notes for a Law Lecture</font></p>
            <p></font></h2> <i><br>
              This document fragment was dated July 1, 1850 by Abraham Lincoln's 
              White House secretaries, John Nicolay and John Hay, who collected 
              many of his manuscripts after his death. The note in the </i>Collected 
              Works of Abraham Lincoln<i> indicates that Lincoln could have 
written these observations several years later than 1850. It is 
not known, however, if Lincoln ever delivered this lecture.<br><br>

In these notes Lincoln provides a glimpse of how he worked 
and the high standards of diligence and honesty he set. 
He has sharp words for the dishonest and unscrupulous members of 
the bar, calling them "fiends" and "knaves." He warns prospective 
lawyers, "if in your own judgment you cannot be an honest lawyer, 
resolve to be honest without being a lawyer."</i><br><br><B>
              I am not an accomplished lawyer. I find quite as much material for 
              a lecture in those points wherein I have failed, as in those wherein 
              I have been moderately successful. The leading rule for the lawyer, 
              as for the man of every other calling, is diligence. Leave nothing 
              for to-morrow which can be done to-day. Never let your correspondence 
              fall behind. Whatever piece of business you have in hand, before 
              stopping, do all the labor pertaining to it which can then be done. 
              When you bring a common-law suit, if you have the facts for doing 
              so, write the declaration at once. If a law point be involved, examine 
              the books, and note the authority you rely on upon the declaration 
              itself, where you are sure to find it when wanted. The same of defenses 
              and pleas. In business not likely to be litigated, -- ordinary collection 
              cases, foreclosures, partitions, and the like, -- make all examinations 
              of titles, and note them, and even draft orders and decrees in advance. 
              This course has a triple advantage; it avoids omissions and neglect, 
              saves your labor when once done, performs the labor out of court 
              when you have leisure, rather than in court when you have not. Extemporaneous 
              speaking should be practised and cultivated. It is the lawyer's 
              avenue to the public. However able and faithful he may be in other 
              respects, people are slow to bring him business if he cannot make 
              a speech. And yet there is not a more fatal error to young lawyers 
              than relying too much on speech-making. If any one, upon his rare 
              powers of speaking, shall claim an exemption from the drudgery of 
              the law, his case is a failure in advance.<br>
              <br>

Discourage litigation. Persuade your neighbors to compromise 
whenever you can. Point out to them how the nominal winner is 
often a real loser -- in fees, expenses, and waste of time. As a 
peacemaker the lawyer has a superior opportunity of being a good man. 
There will still be business enough.<br><br>

Never stir up litigation. A worse man can scarcely be found than 
one who does this. Who can be more nearly a fiend than he who 
habitually overhauls the register of deeds in search of defects in 
titles, whereon to stir up strife, and put money in his pocket? A 
moral tone ought to be infused into the profession which should 
drive such men out of it.<br><br>

The matter of fees is important, far beyond the mere question of 
bread and butter involved. Properly attended to, fuller justice is 
done to both lawyer and client. An exorbitant fee should never be 
claimed. As a general rule never take your whole fee in advance, 
nor any more than a small retainer. When fully paid beforehand, 
you are more than a common mortal if you can feel the same 
interest in the case, as if something was still in prospect for you, as 
well as for your client. And when you lack interest in the case the 
job will very likely lack skill and diligence in the performance. 
Settle the amount of fee and take a note in advance. Then you 
will feel that you are working for something, and you are sure to 
do your work faithfully and well. Never sell a fee note -- at least 
not before the consideration service is performed. It leads to 
negligence and dishonesty -- negligence by losing interest in the case, 
and dishonesty in refusing to refund when you have allowed the 
consideration to fail.<br><br>

There is a vague popular belief that lawyers are necessarily dishonest. 
I say vague, because when we consider to what extent confidence 
and honors are reposed in and conferred upon lawyers by 
the people, it appears improbable that their impression of dishonesty 
is very distinct and vivid. Yet the impression is common, 
almost universal. Let no young man choosing the law for a calling 
for a moment yield to the popular belief -- resolve to be honest at 
all events; and if in your own judgment you cannot be an honest 
lawyer, resolve to be honest without being a lawyer. Choose some 
other occupation, rather than one in the choosing of which you do, 
in advance, consent to be a knave.<br>
